    shortDescription: A library for retrieving and deserializing objects from a jEAP process archive bucket on S3
    longDescription: >
      The jEAP Process Archive Reader Library enables clients to access and read
      artifacts stored in the jEAP Process Archive on an S3-compatible object storage directly as typed objects.
      It automatically retrieves the writer schema from the archive and verifies
      compatibility with the reader schema of the generated class, ensuring safe
      deserialization. The library supports reading specific object versions,
      handling encrypted artifacts via a DecryptingObjectStorageRepository, and
      integrating with jEAP Crypto for key management. It requires an AWS S3Client
      for storage access, which can be auto-configured or instantiated with explicit
      connection settings. This library simplifies interaction with archived process
      data, providing a type-safe and secure way to restore historical objects for
      further processing or analysis.
    features:
      - Reads and deserializes archived objects from S3 with schema compatibility checks
      - Supports versioned retrieval and encrypted object access
      - Integrates with jEAP Crypto for client-side decryption
